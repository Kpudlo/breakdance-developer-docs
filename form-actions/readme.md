# Form Actions API

Creating a Breakdance Form Action involves two steps

1. Create an Action class to represent your field
2. Register the action class with Breakdance

# Creating an action class

To get started create a new PHP class. Your class will need to extend the Breakdance base Action class `Breakdance\Forms\Actions\Action`

## Required Methods

There are three mandatory methods that must be implemented in your action class

**name**

The name method takes no arguments and returns a string that will be used to identify your action in the Form Builder Actions dropdown menu

```php
/**
 * @return string
 */
public function name() {
	return 'My Action';
}
```

**slug**

The slug method takes no arguments and returns a string to identify the form action. This should be unique across all form actions, so it is recommended to prefix the slug appropriately.

```php
/**
 * @return string
*/
public function slug()
{
    return 'my_plugin_form_action';
}
```

**run**

The run method accepts three arguments,  `$form, $settings, $extra` and is called when the form has been submitted

```php
/**
* Log the form submission to a file
*
* @param array $form
* @param array $settings
* @param array $extra
* @return array success or error message
*/
public function run($form, $settings, $extra)
{
    try {
        $this->writeToFile($extra['formId'], $extra['fields']);
    } catch(Exception $e) {
        return ['type' => 'error', 'message' => $e->getMessage()];
    }

    return ['type' => 'success', 'message' => 'Submission logged to file'];
}

```

### Run Arguments

$**form**

The form argument contains all the form fields, their builder settings and the selected values

- type: the field type
- name: the field name
- options: an array of available options for checkbox, radio or select inputs
- value: the submitted value of the field
- originalValue: the default/original value of the field

**$settings**

The settings argument contains an array of the configured form settings from the Breakdance builder

**$extra**

The extra argument contains additional data

- files: An array of uploaded files
- fields: the submitted form fields in an `$id â‡’ $value` style array
- formId: The ID of the form
- postId: The ID of the post the form was submitted from
- ip: the submitters IP address
- referer: The form submitters referrer URL
- userAgent: The form submitters user agent string
- userId: The form submitters user ID (if applicable)

### Responses

The response should be an array that contains a `type` and `message` key.

- type: either `error` or `success`
- message: a string message that will be displayed to admins with the submission

**Success**

```php
public function run($form, $settings, $extra)
{
    ...
    return ['type' => 'success', 'message' => 'Submission logged to file'];
}

```

**Error**

```php
public function run($form, $settings, $extra)
{
    ...
    return ['type' => 'error', 'message' => 'Could not write to file'];
}
```

## Register The Action

Register the action by calling the registerAction helper and passing an instance of your action class

**Note:** To prevent file loading race conditions, it is recommended to call the register helper from inside a WordPress action, e.g init.

```php

// register-actions.php included by your plugin

add_action('init', function() {
    // fail if Breakdance is not installed and available
    if (!function_exists('\Breakdance\Forms\Actions\registerAction') || !class_exists('\Breakdance\Forms\Actions\Action')) {
        return;
    }
    
    require_once('my-action.php');
    
    \Breakdance\Forms\Actions\registerAction(new MyAction());

});
```
